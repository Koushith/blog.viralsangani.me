The short answer is <Special>I want to be the sole owner of the content I write, and Medium just don't allow it.</Special>

Medium is a platform that doesn't get you reputation and views - quality and uniqueness of your content does, regardless of what platform it's on. So you'd better use your own.

**Note:** This is for technical posts only; if you are a non-technical person, writing on Medium is just fine.

  ones who are restless. The ones who strive for change. The ones who see things
  differently. The ones who don't accept the status quo. The ones who challenge
  current thinking patterns. The ones who break down existing barriers. The ones
  who make the impossible possible. The ones who build new things. The ones most
  people call crazy, but we call them passionate. This is for the people just
  like you and me...

I read this article by Yann Girard on [Why you shouldn't blog on Medium](https://yanngirard.typepad.com/yanns_blog/2015/10/why-you-shouldnt-blog-on-medium-.html)

Girard's article clarifies that Medium as a platform was engineered to revolve around the content they have, not the authors.

At the end of the day, Medium is just a company like any other, and their main aim is to make <Sparkles> money </Sparkles>. They do so by capturing attention from people like you and me who are searching for content online.

This is similar to other big conglomerates like Google's Youtube. The difference is youtube earns by Advertisements, and Medium earns by subscriptions.

The point is that Medium does not care about you as a content creator; what they care about is the content you create. And it's a known fact, people go to Medium for content, not for the author. I can bet you don't even know the name of the author of most of the articles you read in Medium.

<Special>
  So, if you are planning to grow your reputation on Medium, chances are you
  can't.

### They charge you for articles

Now, I don't know about you, but most of the content I see on Medium has this tiny star at the top, which says ** "Hey, you can read a few of these per month, but if you want to see more, subscribe!"**.

This isn't very pleasant for free users. They keep showing popups to get paid subscriptions. It's a common technique, and many other companies are using it. But as far as I am concern, <Sparkles>Education should be free.</Sparkles>

I am not against Medium, or the way they make money. They are in the market to make money, and they are pretty good at it. But the thing is, I don't want someone to pay for reading my content, let alone Medium made money from it.

Okay, I know, there are options where I can put my content behind no paywall, but there are still other aspects to it.

### Medium is the owner of your content

Once you put your content on Medium, it's the property of Medium, they can do whatever they want. No doubt your content is protected from international copyright laws, but still, the author should be the one who owns their content, not the platform it's on.

If your content is on Medium they can do whatever they want with it, and you have no say in it.

### It is not for everyone

One thing I don't like about Medium is its WYSIWYG editor. I mean, it looks good, but is it that good? I guess it is useful for non-tech writers, but it's not suitable for technical posts that have software details and code in it. People are asking for code highlighting for years. Still, it does not make it to Medium's backlog.

So sorry Medium, <Sparkles>I LOVE MARKDOWN</Sparkles>, so I'll use my own stack instead.

Django and React is a awsome combination. With React's SPA and Django's long list of helpful libraries, we can create really good website apps. For this application to work, React will have to interact with Django, i.e. retrieve and store data. To create the interface with integration, we will create API in the Back-end(Django) and consume that API in Front-end(React).

### Requirements to follow along with this post

-   a basic understanding of Python and Django
-   a basic understanding of JS(ECMAScript) and ReactJS

Let's start coding.

#### Setting up virtual environment for the project

Never forgot to create a virtual environment for a Django project. Create a folder for your project and move into it. :

```bash
mkdir django-react && cd $_
```

Install dependency for python environment, and create a virtual environment.

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now pull the dependencies for django and rest framework.

```bash
pip install django djangorestframework
```

When it completes you can create a django project.

```bash
django-admin startproject django_react .
```

Now we can start building Django app to store and display contact informations.

### Building Django application

To create an app in Django, run this command,

```bash
python manage.py startapp contact
```

After creating this app your folder structure should look like this,

```bash
(venv) your@prompt:~/Code/django-react$ tree -d -L 1
.
├── contant
├── django_react
└── venv

3 directories
```

Now let's inform django, about this newly created app, move to `django-react/settings.py` and add the app in `INSTALLED_APPS`.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'django.contrib.admin',
    'django.contrib.auth',
    'django.contrib.contenttypes',
    'django.contrib.sessions',
    'django.contrib.messages',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles',
    'contact', # activate the new app
]
```

So far so good, created out basic layout for project, in next section, we will add our models.

### Creating Django models

Model is nothing but a object representing a table's data from database. Almost all advance web framework uses models and Django is no exception.

Since we are creating a contact app, lets add relatent table fiels
Eg: `name`, `email`, `message`, `created_at`.
Your `contact/models.py` should look somthing like this,

```python
from django.db import models

class Contact_info(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    email = models.EmailField()
    message = models.CharField(max_length=300)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

You can go crazy by using more fields for the model, but for the sake of simplicity, we will have only few fields. Check out [django docs for more advance model fields](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/db/models/).
Once you are done with creating models, we can migrate those model to database via these commands,

```python
python manage.py makemigrations contact
python manage.py migrate
```

### Few things about testing

You might be thinking this is a Django + React post, why am i talking about testing. Testing is a really important part of any project. I have seen many django test code like this:

```python
class SomeModelModelTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        SomeModel.objects.create(
            name=fake.name(),
            email=fake.email(),
            phone=fake.phone_number(),
            message=fake.text(),
            source=fake.url()
        )
    def test_save_model(self):
        saved_models = SomeModel.objects.count()
        self.assertEqual(saved_models, 2)
```

Never do that, there is no point in testing vanilla django classes nor django models. Do not test those <Special>things which are already tested.</Special> If you have added custom function of created custong manager for your model, <Special>Test it</Special>. You have custom view in you views.py, then <Special>Test it.</Special>

You might get a question, how to know what should in test? Do yourself a favour and install <Special>Coverage</Special>.

```bash
pip install coverage
```

Every time you add something in project, may me model or views, anything, run this coverage on test to know what exactly you have missed in your tests.

```bash
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
```

and then you can gnenerate a html generate with this tool,

```bash
coverage html
```

If you are still there, then in next section we will create our serializers for REST APIs.

### Creating Django REST serializers

What is serialization? It is the act of transforming an object into another data format. In our case from database values to json object. How to do that? Using Django REST serializer!

You can use Django REST serializer, which will take the burden off you, but there might be some complex cases when you just can't figure out how to do that, in that cases you have to serialize data manually, there are functions in djangorestframework to do so.

In this case we will take advantage of django serializers. Create a file `contact/serializers.py`, and then create a ContactSerializers.

```python
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Contact_info

class ContactSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = Contact_info
        fields = ('id', 'name', 'email', 'message')
```

### Settings up Views and Urls

Open `contact/views.py` and create this view,

```python
from .models import Contact_info
from .serializers import ContactSerializer
from rest_framework import generics

class ContactListCreate(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    queryset = Contact_info.objects.all()
    serializer_class = ContactSerializer
```

This is the magic of django, just with three lines, we have created POST and GET views for django.

Let's focus on URLs. To configure the urls we need to include app urls in `django_react/urls.py`

```python
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('', include('contact.urls')),
]
```

Next up create a new fle `contact/urls.py`. Then we will connect our `ContactListCreate` view to a URL.

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('api/conatct/', views.ContactListCreate.as_view() ),
]
```

Finally add Django rest framework in `django_react/settings`. Add `rest_framework` in INSTALLED_APPS.

```python
# Application definition

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # omitted for brevity
    'contact',
    'rest_framework'
]
```

Now you can check the working with

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Go to browsabel API at <Special>http://localhost:8000/api/contact/</Special>

### Moving to ReactJS

I have seen many django developers to struggle with this question, <Special> How to glue Django and React</Special>. Belive me I have gone through this phase.

Some common question comes to mind is, <Special>Should React Router takes over the routing? or should React mount each component in Django template?</Special> I would say <Sparkles>it depends.</Sparkles> It depends how good you are with javascript.

So there are <Sparkles>Two ways</Sparkles> to setup Django and ReactJS.

**Option 1**

React in its own "frontend" Django app. Load single HTML template via Django and let React do its thing.
(difficulty: medium)

**Option 2**

Django Rest Fremework as standalone API and React as standalone SPA. (difficulty: medium - hard, it involves authenticating via JWT. I will write a blog for DRF and JWT soon.)

In this post, we will go through **Option 2**. If you want me to go through **Option 1** as well, let me know at [viral.sangani2011@gmail.com](mailto:viralsangani.2011@gmail.com)

Since we are moving with Option 2, we need to make few changes in Django app, so that it will allow our React app to communicate via APIs.
We need to install `django-cors-headers`

```bash
pip install django-cors-headers
```

Now, head over to `django_react/settings.py` and add this lines.

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # omitted for brevity
    'contact',
    'rest_framework'
    'corsheaders' # <== This is new
]
```

In the same file edit this

```Python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    ....
    'corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware', # <== Add this line in MIDDLEWARE
    'django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware',
]

CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL = True # <== Add this line anywhere in the settings.py
```

`CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL = True` will allow all IP to connect to out APIs. This is okay for development, but if you want to restrict this, you cam create a Whitelist of IPs. Go through [this](https://pypi.org/project/django-cors-headers/) to know more.

Greate now Django part is over, we can move to React.

### ReactJS

Requirements: You need to install npm and nodejs to follow along.

Let's create a react app using `create-react-app`. If you don't have `create-react-app` I'd suggest go [here](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can create a new folder `django-react-frontend` somewhere else, and follow along.

```bash
npx create-react-app django-react .
```

We will install few dependencies for react.

```bash
npm install axios --save
```

[Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) is the promise-based HTTP client that we’ll use to make HTTP request calls to our Django API.

Now you have you basic react app ready.

![React Starter](react-starter.png)

Now Let's edit out `App.js` to make a API call via axios to Django. Make sure you django server is online at `http://localhost:8000`.

Paste this code in `App.js`.

```js
import React from 'react'
import './App.css'
import axios from 'axios'

function App() {
    const [values, setValues] = React.useState([])
    React.useEffect(() => {
        axios.get('http://localhost:8000/api/contact/').then((res) => {
            console.log(res.data)
            setValues(res.data)
        })
    }, [])
    return (
        <div className="App">
            <header className="App-header">
                <p>Data from Django</p>
                {values.length > 0 &&
                    values.map((value) => {
                        return (
                            <div
                                key={value.id}
                                style={{ borderBottom: '2px solid white' }}
                            >
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Name:</strong> {value.name}
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Email:</strong> {value.email}
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Message:</strong> {value.message}
                                </p>
                            </div>
                        )
                    })}
            </header>
        </div>
    )
}

export default App
```

This will make a call to DRF and display that data.

![React Django](react-django-fianl.png)

This is a very simple example of integration of Django and React. You can do a lot of things now.

In this Post we have,

-> build a Django REST API  
-> structure Django Project with React  
-> connect React to Django API

Feel free to experiment by adding more features to the project (like authentication).The approach we took when connecting the React frontend to Django was a bit simplistic, but represent a strong foundation of what you'll do in the real world.
